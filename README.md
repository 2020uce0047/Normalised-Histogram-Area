# Normalised-Histogram-Area
Calculating the normalised area of the histogram from an image

let's suppose following is the histogram for which noramlised area has to be estimated:

Normalised area, mathematically is given by 
          (x0y0 + x1y1 + x2y2 + x3y3 + ...)/(y1 + y2 + y3 + y4 + ......)
          where xi denotes the
